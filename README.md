# Columbia_Algorithmic_Project

The 2nd Group Project on Sentimental Algorithmic Trading

## Introduction

We arrived at this project due to the excellent gains made on a paper trading account held with Alpaca Markets Brokerage. Alpaca provides access to US stock markets, historical data, and fundamental data through its API. We learned about Alpaca from this Financial Technology Computer Programming Course offered by Columbia University in the City of New York and began to trade with Alpaca through a course offered on Udemy by Mayank Rasu, Vice President, Quantitative Analytics, at Barclays Investment Bank.

Jeff Smith began this venture by modifying the files provided and selected the most profitable ETFs. With the overall 3xs leveraged ETFs, he quicky began to realize that by following the market and the news both live on the televison and on the financial websites, he could quickly enter the market and earn leveraged gains by buying or shorting the leveraged ETFs, inverted or otherwise, and exit the positions quickly.

Russell Moore is our expert on machine learning and he undertook to train, along with Gao Sheng, a sentimental machine learning algorithm to interpret the headlines as either positive or negative for the Nasdaq, and then we could theoretically trade based on the machine learning signals.

Mike Cutno began to envision the use of technical indicators to help us exit the trade when it was most appropriate, either by trading or by giving us an alert that the technical indicators have been reached to potentially exit the trade.
